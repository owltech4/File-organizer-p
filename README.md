This file organizer is a tool that automatically organizes files in a directory based on file type, name, date, or size. It includes features like:

 - Moving files to designated folders.
 - Renaming files based on patterns.
 - Archiving old files.


The `config.ini` file will allow users to define how they want their files organized. INI files are simple to read and edit.
